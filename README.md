This project was made with the help of a tutorial by [Traversy Media](youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) that showed me how to work with things
like Sass, CSS Grid and Media Queries to create a responsive, modern looking portfolio site.
I had a lot of fun working on this one, as I've never been a huge fan of CSS, but Sass made
everything easier! This site will also serve as the proto design for my real portfolio site,
which is made in GastbyJS.
